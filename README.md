### Overview

This project is meant to be a starting port for future Investec Programmable Banking Cards projects. 

There are limitations for Investec's online code editor, there is only the main.js file which limits you from seperating files and having a maintainable project.

This starter project uses ES Build in order to complile the TS files into a single file for copying and pasting into main.js on Investec's Online Editor.
